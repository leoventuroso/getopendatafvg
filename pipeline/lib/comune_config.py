"""Single source of truth for per-deployment municipality settings.

Every pipeline script that needs the OSM area, ISTAT code, or municipal
boundary reads it from here instead of hardcoding its own copy. The frontend
reads the same JSON file directly (see frontend/src/config.ts).

To deploy this for a different comune: edit frontend/src/comune.config.json
(see SETUP.md for the full checklist, including which raw data files each
value depends on).
